Depending on the #link("/meta/role", "role") of a user, they can read/write to
certain #link("/meta/namespace", "namespace").

Each user gets a namespace of their own automatically.

Each installation starts with a "meta" user, who owns the "meta" namespace,
which all users have access to, and contains the wiki's documentation.
