Depending on the [role](/meta/roles) of a user, they can read/write to certain
[namespaces](/meta/namespaces).

Each user gets a namespace of their own automatically.

Each installation starts with a "meta" user, who owns the "meta" namespace,
which all users have access to, and contains the wiki's documentation.
